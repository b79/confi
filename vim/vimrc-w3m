" This vimrc file is called by w3m when saving html files as text.
" In w3m's options, set "Editor" to "vim -u ~/.vimrc-w3m", and vim 
" will make the following substitutions, filter with par to create
" line-breaks at 80 collumns, and delete the temp file in the 
" ~/.w3m/ directory. Then, use the :write command to save the text 
" file in a location of your choosing. Or use mappings like so:
"   vmap <leader>wf y :w ~/fields/<c-r>".txt
"   nmap <leader>wf :w ~/fields/.txt<left><left><left><left>
"
