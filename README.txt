This is a collection of config files & scripts I've written to make some things
easier to do on my Linux system. I've called the containing directory 'confi'
with the idea this could be a weird way of saying the plural of 'conf' files
(a la cactus & cacti), but mostly just to give it a unique name.

Anyhow, I've gathered them together in a git repository so as to keep track of
changes and make things more sharable. I'll do my best to keep it all living
out there on the internet somewhere.

HTH,

John Magolske
